                I treasure every moment i have with you. Lost and alone i will never be, only because (to all my readers/if i had a best friend (wich i don&#039;t) this is what i would say to him/her.) poem submitted: I have never felt so lucky in my life than the moment you became mine.
    </p>

    <h3>Here are you mean so much to me messages, quotes and sayings for husband, wife, boyfriend and girlfriend that worth sending to your lover.</h3>
    <p>Hoagland&#039;s poems are bursting with personal details and introspection, yet while peering into the depths of his own psyche, he opens his observations up. I need to let you know mother how much you really mean to me so i&#039;m telling you now you mean the world to me. I have never felt so lucky in my life than the moment you became mine. You&#039;re everything i think about, everything i need and everything i want.</p>
