    <p>The image of the &#039;shining stream&#039; returns later in the poem as &#039;broken water&#039;, suggesting that ridge&#039;s memory of her mother from her childhood is impressionistic and unclear. And it was not without a reason, because all women hold an enchanting mystery within them that captures men&#039;s hearts. Appa, na i gyeolhon an hallaeyo! Copyright © 1987 by margaret atwood.</p>
