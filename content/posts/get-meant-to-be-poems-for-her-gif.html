                Male poets are often shown composing sonnets for their leading ladies the thought of violets meant florists&#039; shops, / and bows and pins, and perfumed papers fine. 2 i&#039;m sorry that i forgot your trouble and worries are not what i sought i hope i can help you, i truly do, i never meant to be mean towards you. All along i knew we were meant to be together, the way you made me feel was just out of this world.
